* Notes for csvconvert

** TODO add argparse to spec input/output file

   How this would work:
   --infile (-i) : the input file
   [--outfile] (-o) : optional the output file
      default file name would be out-<datefrom>-<date-to>.csv

** TODO add detection of dialect
   
   Open the output file, and detect the dialect.. Had an issue
   recently which broke parsing, because ING changed the format
